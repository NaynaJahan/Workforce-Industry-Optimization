# Workforce-Industry-Optimization
The objective of this project is to examine how the factors correlated with productivity, such as team size, SMV (standard minute valueâ€”allocated time for a task), and idle workers, impact the overtime consumed while working in the garment industry. The analysis will put the results of the linear regression model and random forest model in comparison to determine whether the nonlinear interactions among the features could improve the prediction accuracy.

## This report proposes the following research questions:
1. How do operational factors like team size, SMV, and idle workers contribute to overtime in a linear relationship?
2. Can a non-linear, ensemble-based model (Random Forest) provide more accurate overtime predictions by capturing the complex interactions between
worker count, task complexity, and idle time? 

## To address these questions, the project objectives are:
1. Identify garment industry datasets that contain information on team size, SMV, idle workers, and overtime hours.
2. Preprocess the data, including cleaning and transforming variables to make them suitable for modeling; visualize the missing data in a heatmap.
3. Build a linear regression model to analyze the direct, linear influence of production factors on overtime. Develop a Random Forest model to capture potential non-linear relationships between variables.
4. Assess and compare the performance of both models and determine whether the Random Forest model significantly improves prediction accuracy.
5. Analyze and interpret the results to provide useful insights for garment manufacturers, such as identifying key factors that drive overtime and offering potential solutions to reduce unnecessary overtime.
